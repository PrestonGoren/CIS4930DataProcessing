## how this assignment should be modified in order to become an “official” assignment in the future

I liked this assignment. I enjoyed that I was able to complete it with whichever language I wanted, and that all I had to do was share the github repo. I think for future versions it might be tough on graders to have to replicate each student's implementation -- especially if a student uses an obscure package or language. Perhaps there is a way to allow the assignment to be completed in any language while also allowing for grading to be streamlined so that the graders do not need to clone each repo individually.
